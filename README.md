# Moneytary

Moneytary is a personal finance app featuring Sally, your secretary who is happy to take note of your expenses but frowns on extravagant spending. Users can input an amount spent, the date the purchase was made, and tag the purchases however they'd like. The app will return how much the user has spent this month, how much they've spent this year, and how much they've spent this month in each category they've just tagged. A "return" button allows the user to return to the main page if they'd like to add more expenses. Meanwhile, Sally can't help but pass commentary on your purchases!

Features:
-- Responsive layout via 9-patch images
-- SQL database that remembers prior purchases and tags
-- SQL queries that return a summary of expenses
-- SQL queries that return all recently used tags and all recent expenses
-- Deletable expenses in ListView, which refreshes and repopulates
-- Custom dialog calendar
-- Custom ArrayAdapter handling ListView items
-- Autofill tags populated by SQL
-- Filled field validation and toasts confirming inputs
